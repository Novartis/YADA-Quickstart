<h1>${project.artifactId}-${project.version}</h1>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<h4>tl;dr: Read the README.html (this file) after installation for launch instructions.</h4>

<p>The ${project.artifactId} installer will create a <code>${project.artifactId}-${project.version}</code>
 directory in a defined location. You'll have the option of designating a directory for install or accepting the default.</p>
 
<p>The installer will then perform the following tasks</p>

<ol>
<li>Install apache-tomcat, a few sql scripts, and the <code>${project.artifactId}-${project.version}.war</code> file</li>
<li>Explode the war file</li>
<li>Prompt for apache-tomcat port numbers. (Values other than tomcat defaults are chosen in the likely case a user already has an instance of tomcat running.)</li>
<li>Set some property values in config and script files</li>
<li>Populate the default YADA index, a SQLite db included in the war</li>
<li>Compress the reconfigured webapp into a new war file (i.e., overwrite it)</li>
<li>Clean up</li>
</ol> 

<p>Originally the installer launched tomcat, ran a sanity check, and launched the yada-admin tool, 
but this hasn't worked universally. It also maybe is a little presumptuous. You can follow the remaining
directions to perform these tasks.</p>
